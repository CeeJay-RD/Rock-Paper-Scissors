# Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this project I've created a rock, paper scissors using prompt and the console.




## Pseudo code

 * When a user inputs an option compare with computers selection
 * If the user wins, give 1 point to the user
 * If the computer wins, give 1 point to the computer
 * Loop the round 5 times and print the result of each round with the score
 * Once the game's finished, print who's the winner and how many point the winner won with
## Roadmap
 * ~~Adenter code hered a responsive UI~~
