# Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this project I've created a rock, paper scissors using prompt and the console.




## Pseudo code

* When a user inputs an option compare with computers selection
* If the user wins, give 1 point to the user
* If the computer wins, give 1 point to the computer
* Loop the round 5 times and print the result of each round with the score
* Once the game's finished, print who's the winner and how many point the winner won with
## Roadmap

~~ - Add a responsive UI ~~
